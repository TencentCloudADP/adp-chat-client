### PR Workflow

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the `Fork` button on our GitHub main page to create your own copy of the repository.

### 2. Clone the Repository Locally

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:TencentCloudADP/adp-chat-client.git
```

### 3. Add the Upstream remote

Connect the upstream (original) repository to your local repo:

```bash
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:TencentCloudADP/adp-chat-client.git
```

### 4. Sync with Upstream

Keep your local repository up to date with the main repository:

```bash
$ git pull --rebase upstream main
```

### 5. Create a Branch

Avoid committing directly to main. Create a feature branch, preferably following the `dev-xxx` naming convention.

```bash
$ git checkout -b <dev-xxx>
```

### 6. Commit Code

This project follows the `Conventional Commits` specification and uses [**Commitizen**](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to help generate standardized commit messages.

Please use `cz commit` to make commits, and avoid using `git commit` directly.

#### Commitizen Usage Guide

1. Choose an installation method for your environment:

   * Install in the project:

   ```bash
   # Install via pip
   pip install -U commitizen

   # Install via conda
   conda install -c conda-forge commitizen
   ```

   * Global installation:

   ```bash
   # Install via pipx
   pipx install commitizen
   pipx upgrade commitizen

   # Install via uv
   uv tool install commitizen
   uv tool upgrade commitizen

   # Install via Homebrew (macOS)
   brew install commitizen
   ```
2. After `git add`, use:

   ```bash
   $ cz commit
   ```

   > Commitizen will guide you through filling out the commit message according to the repo‚Äôs configuration. Please follow the prompts strictly.

#### Conventional Commits Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
(BREAKING CHANGE: )<footer>
```

#### Format Explanation

1. `Header`:

   * `<type>`: Commit type:

     * `fix`: Bug fix
     * `feat`: New feature
     * `docs`: Documentation
     * `style`: Code style
     * `refactor`: Refactor, not a fix or feature
     * `perf`: Performance optimization
     * `test`: Tests
     * `build`: Changes to the build system
     * `ci`: Changed to the config files
   * `<scope>`: the area of change, such as a module, component, or file::
     * `client`
     * `server`
     * `deploy`
     * `Makefile`
   * `<subject>`: A concise description of the change
2. `Body`: A detailed description of the motivation, specific changes, and how behavior differs from before.
3. `Footer`:

   * `BREAKING CHANGE`: List all breaking changes
   * `Issue Closing/Linking`: Use `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` to close related Issues, and `Issue #789` to link to a related Issue

#### Example

```text
feat(server): add user login verification

- add user login API endpoint

Closes #123
```

### 7. Push Code

Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
$ git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

On GitHub, go to your repository, click `New Pull Request`, select the branch you just pushed, and submit a `Pull Request` to the main repository. Make sure your `Pull Request` clearly describes what issue it solves or what new feature it adds, and references the related `Issue`.

### 9. Sync Upstream Updates

If new commits land on the upstream branch after you‚Äôve opened your PR, please rebase your branch to keep a linear history and reduce conflicts:

```bash
# Ensure you are on your branch
$ git checkout <your-branch-name>

# Stay in sync with upstream and rebase
$ git pull --rebase upstream main

# push
$ git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
```

Finally, please verify your PR status and confirm that the PR‚Äôs `diff` contains only your intended changes.
