# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors, maintainers, and participants in the adp-chat-client community, we strive to build an open and welcoming community. We pledge to respect everyone who reports issues, proposes features, updates documentation, submits PRs or patches, attends meetings or events, and takes part in other community and project activities.

We commit to behaving and interacting in ways that foster an open, friendly, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and to ensuring that everyone participating in the CNCF community is free from harassment, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, family status, gender, gender identity and expression, marital status, military or veteran status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, tribe, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include, but are not limited to:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting different claims, opinions, viewpoints, and feelings
* Offering and graciously accepting constructive feedback
* Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on the community’s shared goals rather than personal gain
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information—such as a physical or email address—without explicit permission
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered a violation of professional standards of behavior

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the community in public settings.
