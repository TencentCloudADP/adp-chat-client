---

Running **adp-chat-client** on a **Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM)** allows you to better manage your development environment, maintain data security, and ensure stable access in the cloud.  
Tencent Cloud provides high-performance CVM products that can help enhance your development and deployment experience.

This tutorial walks you through creating and setting up a Tencent Cloud CVM instance for running the **adp-chat-client** system.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A **Tencent Cloud account**  
  You can [register one here](https://www.tencentcloud.com/login).
- A **local machine** (your computer) to access and manage the CVM.

---

## Steps

### 1. Log in and get started

Log in to your [Tencent Cloud account](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) and open the **CVM product page**:  
- [Tencent Cloud CVM – Get Started](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cvm)

---

### 2. Configure and purchase your CVM instance

On the **Custom Configuration** page, select the following options based on your needs:

- **Billing Mode** (Pay as you go or spot instances)
- **Region** (choose the location of the data center)
- **Instance model** (e.g., Standard, MEM-optimized)
- **Image** (choose your OS — Ubuntu or TencentOS)


You can access the configuration page here:  
[Custom Configuration](http://manage.qcloud.com/shoppingcart/shop.php?tab=cvm&_ga=1.91351132.770173325.1571651505)

For detailed configuration options, refer to:

- [Customizing Linux CVM Configurations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10517)
- [Customizing Windows CVM Configurations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10516)

---

### 3. Log in to your CVM instance

Once the CVM instance is successfully created, you can log in and start using it as your remote server.

- [Logging in to a Linux Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436)
- [Logging in to a Windows Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10514)

After logging in, you can install dependencies and deploy **adp-chat-client** just like you would on a local machine.

> **Tip:** For Linux users, we recommend using SSH to access the CVM terminal.  
> For Windows users, you can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or PowerShell.

## Next Steps

Once your CVM is up and running, proceed to: [Quick Start](/docs/en/quick-start)

This documents explain how to initialize your environment, set up `.env` files, and start the **adp-chat-client** service.
