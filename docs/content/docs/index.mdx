## Overview

adp-chat-client is an open-source chat frontend for AI agent applications. It lets you take agents built on the [Tencent Cloud Agent Development Platform (Tencent Cloud ADP)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/tcadp) and publish them quickly as a web app, with easy embedding in Mini Programs, Android, iOS, and more. The system includes real-time chat, conversation history, voice input, and image understanding, and supports third-party identity integration (OAuth / URL redirect). The frontend uses the TDesign component system with theme/UX customization; the backend ships with Docker for fast deployment, reducing integration and ops overhead.

## Why adp-chat-client

* **Go live in 5 minutes**: one-click Docker deployment skips lengthy environment setup and module wiring, moving faster from build to launch.
* **0 friction ADP integration**: plug directly into ADP’s mature capabilities (NLP, multimodal interaction, knowledge base/RAG, workflows, etc.)—no reinventing the wheel.
* **Enterprise-grade end-to-end**: identity, audit & compliance, persistent/retrievable chat data, HTTPS/reverse proxy—covering the full journey from UX to governance.

## Core Capabilities

* **Multi-platform delivery**: Web first; embeddable in Mini Programs / Android / iOS.
* **Real-time chat**: stable connectivity to ADP agents; supports text and mixed text-image interactions.
* **Conversation history**: automatic persistence; organize by user/app/time; search and export (integrates with PostgreSQL, etc.).
* **Voice input**: Tencent Cloud ASR over WebSocket for low latency (=< 800 ms).
* **Image understanding**: upload/parse images within chats for natural multimodal flows.
* **Identity integration**: GitHub and Microsoft Entra ID (OAuth); or a lightweight URL-redirect flow for in-house identity.
* **Themes & UI**: TDesign-based theming and component extensions.
* **Containerized deployment**: Docker packaging for reusable environments, smooth migrations, canary and rollback.

## Main Components

### 1. Frontend

* **Stack**: Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript + TDesign
* **Highlights**:

  * High component reuse; easy to maintain
  * Customizable theme colors, font sizes, and interaction behavior
  * Fits enterprise embedding (iFrame / WebView / Mini Program web container, etc.)

### 2. Backend

* **Stack**: Python (Sanic)
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Unified **router** exposing HTTP endpoints
  * Business **core** wrapping ADP and third-party calls
  * **Middleware** for auth, audit, rate limiting, logging, and other governance features
  * **Config** system for secrets and multi-env parameters
  * **Persistence** for conversations and user state (e.g., PostgreSQL)

## Identity Integration

Two login integration options help you adapt to different enterprise IT setups:

### 1) OAuth

GitHub OAuth and Microsoft Entra ID OAuth are supported out of the box via `.env` configuration.
To add other providers, extend the adapter logic in `server/core/oauth.py`.
**Pros:** minimal changes, unified identity & permissions, audit/compliance friendly.

### 2) URL Redirect

If you have an in-house identity system but no standard OAuth yet, use a lightweight redirect flow:

* Your existing system generates a login URL carrying `CustomerId`, `Name`, `ExtraInfo`, `Timestamp`, `Code`
* After HMAC-SHA256 verification, the chat client auto-creates/binds the account and establishes a session
  **Best for:** legacy systems that are hard to modify, where “login-free” handoff is needed quickly.

## Architecture

| Component  | Description                                                   |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config     | Configuration system                                          |
| core       | Core logic, decoupled from transport (e.g., http/stdio)       |
| middleware | Sanic server middleware                                       |
| router     | Public HTTP entry point, typically a thin wrapper over `core` |
| static     | Static assets                                                 |
| test       | Tests                                                         |
| util       | Utility helpers                                               |
